          h5.maincolor The Pig game
          p Plays between 2 players.
					p Goal: be the first player to reach maximal score (by default 100). Can be played with one or two dices.
          h5.maincolor Gameplay
          h6.maincolor One dice:
          p On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly until either: 
            ul 
              li A 1 is rolled: that player's turn ends and no points are earned.
              li The player chooses to hold (stop rolling): all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.
          h6.maincolor Two dices:
          p If a player rolls a single 1, the turn ends and no points are scored. However, if a player rolls double 1s, that counts as 25 points. Other doubles are worth double points, so that a 2-2 is worth 8 points, 3-3 is worth 12, 4-4 is worth 16, 5-5 is worth 20, and 6-6 is worth 24.
          h5.maincolor Game end
          p When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
          h5.maincolor Scoring examples
          p Example 1: Sherri rolls a 3 and decides to continue. She then chooses to roll seven more times (6, 6, 6, 4, 5, 6, 1). Because she rolled a 1, Sherri's turn ends and she earns 0 points. 
          p Example 2: Craig rolls a 6 and decides to continue. He then chooses to roll four more times (3, 4, 2, 6) and decides to hold. Craig earns 21 points for this turn (6+3+4+2+6=21).
